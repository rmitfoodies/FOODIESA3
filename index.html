								<b> Andrew Zhang</b>
								<p> My name is Andrew Zhang, my student number is s3786306, my background is Chinese however, I was born here in Australia. My hobbies include listening/playing music, sports, gym, eating food, playing video games and spending too much time doing what I’m not supposed to. For me, my IT exists in the world of automation, I was very interested when the first auto drive from Tesla was introduced, it showed me the power of the world of IT and made me pursue it more, I think this not only sparked my interest but has opened my eyes to the capabilities that the world I live in has. For the longest time, I thought that in my lifetime of give or take 80-90, that nothing world changing would happen, however, I think Elon Musk has opened a door for me and I want to be a part of something amazing/new/exciting. We decided to choose the name Foodies since our partner, Patrick, was interested in making an app similar to Zomato and so we compromised and chose to go with his idea. </p>

								<h2 class="major"> GROUP PROCESS </h2>
							<p> For assignment 2 our group worked well together to complete the report, we managed to complete it in time with all the required information. 
							The one thing that stood out with assignment 2 was our ability to communicate with each other with instant response which made the assignment easy to complete with each other.</p> 
<p> 	For our assignment 3 process, we will work on the assignment straight away and each week rather than leaving it to the last week to complete it and we will continue to communicate with each other if we have any questions about the assignment. </p>

						<!-- IDEAL JOB -->
							<article id="3">
								
								<h2 class="major"> IDEAL JOBS</h2>
							   <b> Patrick La</b>
							   <p> I have chosen “Senior Network/Senior Engineer as my ideal job. The job is apart of the company Sparx Solutions, I have heard many good reviews about the company. They have a reputation and have been included in the Australian Financial Review’s Fast Starters in 2018, 12th in CRN’s Fast 50 in 2018 and Juniper Network’s Emerging Partner of the Year in 2016. This position is appealing to me because it is a job that I cannot get straight away from graduating, it requires me to apply for other jobs within the field and work up towards this goal. As a Network/Security Engineer you must have strong technical knowledge and capabilities. The skills that are required for this position are having experience in routing and switching within the Cisco environment. This will require me to sign up for Cisco training and certifications in the future. You will also need to understand a lot in the security department. For Example, being able to analyse patterns of security events from firewalls, IDS, IPS, SIEM and other security data sources. The job also requires you to have an extensive knowledge in deploying and securing Microsoft Azure environment. Microsoft Azure is a public cloud computing platform which is used for virtual computing, storage and networking and plenty of other services. The skills, qualifications and experience that I have currently are very barebones. I have a very weak coding knowledge as I have only worked with java. I have very basic knowledge in networking, but I have worked with a virtual machine before and setup roles. Very basic subnetting schemes and implementing IPv4 addressing and some very basic configuring & troubleshooting in ethernet networks via Cisco CLI on Router and Switch platforms.
My plan would be to finish my course in Bachelors of Information of Technology or i would possibly move into Computer Science or maybe even Software Engineering instead of the standard Information Technology course. I would obtain the skills and experience by getting professional industry certifications in security/networking
For Example: CCNP(CISCO), CCIE(CISCO), PCNSE(Palo Alto Networks) - These certifications require you to take an exam. </p> </p><span class="image main"><img src="images/j1.png" alt="" /></span>
                               
							   <b> Christian Phongsavan</b>
							   <p> The position is to work as a Database Administrator for Robert Half Technology’s Technical Services IT team and to be involved in technical support and maintenance of their IT Infrastructure, Databases and services. This is appealing to me because I would like to work for a company that is technology based that has a position available near Melbourne because it would be easy for me to get to. Also, data interests me so working as a Database Admin for a big company would be a good career goal. For the position, a big amount of skill is required. You must be able to problem solve issues across systems and database infrastructure, install, configure and maintain databases in technical server environments. For the position you must also have successful experience with Microsoft’s SQL, Amazon Web Services, troubleshooting and fixing database issues and scripting, automation in C#, HTML, PHP, VB,net and PowerShell. At the start of my first year in university I only have experience in fixing database issues, and I have started to learn HTML and software like SQL. I will obtain the skills necessary by completing my Bachelor of IT while picking more electives related to data analysation. From they I will work as a database analyst until I have possessed the skills necessary in problem solving, software related to data to become a database manager and from years of working I’ll work my way up to becoming a senior database manager. </p> </p> </p><span class="image main"><img src="images/j2.png" alt="" /></span>
						      
							   <b> Andrew Zhang</b>
							   <p> A software automation engineer would be my Ideal Job. When I first saw Tesla’s auto drive, I was astonished at its capabilities and was instantly attracted to the idea of a car that had the capability to drive you home. I think in the future that a lot of things around the world would become automated. Having transport become the first, I believe is a huge leap into the future, is incredible. I think if I could start working in the automation industry, it would cover a huge range of what I would need to learn for the future. This would prepare me to become more adaptable in the future. Especially with the soon expected life on mars, where for now, all things are automated.
The job itself is what I believe the product of the IT course. It requires the developer to have at least 5 years of experience with testing on automation frameworks as well as testing of management tools for CI/CD, for example, they recommend the Jenkins software found in Java. It does require a master of computer science or something else related. To have an excellent understanding of data structures and algorithms, to be committed to writing plenty of high-quality software. Have a good fundamental understanding of QA concepts, terminology and lifecycles. The good thing is it requires a minimum of 5 years of experience of languages such as go, Python or Java to which I have already started. Heavy understanding and experience with developing scripts using shell, Perl or something similar. Knowledge of working with a full-development lifecycle of large-scale industrial or service based applications. Finally, experience with the Linux system including network configuration, web technologies, system settings, common commands/utilities.
Currently, I’m passionate but still new to the world of IT. I have only a couple months of experience with a language (java) and some basic knowledge with python. I have little to no experience with Linux. Firstly, I believe I should figure out what the terms that the job required mean. Besides that, utilising the most of RMIT would be the best thing, for now, making sure I never miss a lecture and always do the work that is requested of me. To keep up to date is probably the hardest thing for me to do right now since I find everything very hard. I started to also use some external learning services such as code academy to learn more about languages and have also downloaded a Linux operating software on my computer so I can dabble with it. I’ve also been going to CSIT for help and getting to learn more from the sophomores and third years on the side. This has been very enlightening to me as well as helpful in better understanding the lectures. I try and meet new people who have had more experience with IT or anything IT related. So far I’ve met many nice and helpful people that are willing to spare me their time so I can gather a better understanding of coding and the general stuff. </p> </p> </p><span class="image main"><img src="images/j3.png" alt="" /></span>

							    							    <b> COMMON ELEMENTS </b>
																<p> Between the 3 different jobs, they all share some of the same elements. All 3 jobs require the employee to work in a team that plays a certain role for a company, for example, a Software Automation Engineer has to join a small team to help build software for a company’s systems for their products. A Senior Network/Security Engineer joins a company's professional services team to lead network and security functions for customers and a Senior Database Administrator works in a Technical Services IT team to support and maintain a company's IT infrastructure, database and services. Other common elements for the 3 jobs is that they require years of hands on experience in their related field, they all require expert knowledge in their related software, the employee will have strong interpersonal communication skills to be able to communicate with team members and for each position they require tertiary qualifications in either IT, Computer Science or related disciplines.
 </p>
								<b> DIFFERENCES </b>
								<p> What differentiates from each position is the in depth knowledge and the roles of the fields. A Senior Database Administrator focuses on development and maintenance of server database systems while being an expert in understanding SQL software, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and the whole process of designing, creating and fixing databases. A senior Network/Security Engineer focuses on leading network and security functions in a customer environment, they will be experts in understanding and utilising networking, security and cloud computing. This differs from the rest because of the knowledge of different software and hardware like routing and switching within a Cisco environment and firewall architecture. Finally a Software Automation Engineer focuses on building world class software for a company’s systems that manufactures their products such as cars, this position would also require the employee to have expert knowledge on automation framework tools, software programming and an understanding of QA concepts, terminology and lifecycles.  </p>

							   	     <b> Andrew Zhang</b>
							   <p>Software Automation Engineer for Tesla
							      <p> </p>
								     <p>Since I am new to the Information Industry, my plan is to get a good fundamental understanding of QA concepts, terminology and lifecycles. While doing the Bachelor of Information Technology, I will obtain experience with coding languages such as Python and Java which is required for the position. I would also require heavy knowledge around scripts. This can all be learnt throughout the Bachelor of IT and related electives. Since the position requires 5 years of experience, I would have to apply for job related to software development and build up my skills as an individual then i’ll be able to apply for positions that require experience in the field. 
 </p>
 </p>   <b> Patrick La</b>
							     <p>Senior Network/Security Engineer for a Managed IT Service Company
								    <p> </p>
									   <p>My plan is to finish my Bachelor of Information Technology or possibly move into Computer Science or Software Engineering to stand out instead of completing the regular Information Technology course. Throughout my studies I would obtain skills and experience in professional industry certifications in security and networking. For example; CCNP, CCIE and PCNSE which are certificates from CISCO and Palo Alto Networks. After obtaining the experience and knowledge required, I will be able to apply for a job related to the network or security of a company. </p>

   <p> </p>
     <b>SIMILARITIES </b>
 <p> A similarity throughout the career plans are that we plan to obtain our fundamental knowledge for our jobs by choosing related electives in our Bachelor of Information Technology Course. Another similarity is that we plan to get experience for our job by applying for positions with related skills for smaller companies to build our knowledge for the bigger and future positions we intend to get.
 </p>
 <p> </p>
<b>DIFFERENCES </b>
 <p>The main difference throughout our career plans is the field that we intend to go into. For example Andrew intends to go into Software Automation which requires deep knowledge in data structures and algorithms and applying them to products related too the automation industry, Patrick intends to focus more on the security and network frameworks of a company and Christian intends to focus on the management of data for a company.
